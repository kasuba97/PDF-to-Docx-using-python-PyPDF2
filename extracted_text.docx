Climate Changen summary
CLIMATE CHANGE IS ONE OF THE DEFINING ISSUES OF OUR TIME. It is now more certain 
than ever, based on many lines of evidence, that humans are changing Earth’s climate. The 
atmosphere and oceans have warmed, which has been accompanied by sea level rise, a strong 
decline in Arctic sea ice, and other climate-related changes. The impacts of climate change on 
people and nature are increasingly apparent. Unprecedented flooding, heat waves, and wildfires 
have cost billions in damages. Habitats are undergoing rapid shifts in response to changing 
temperatures and precipitation patterns. 
The Royal Society and the US National Academy of Sciences, with their similar missions to 
promote the use of science to benefit society and to inform critical policy debates, produced the 
original Climate Change: Evidence and Causes in 2014. It was written and reviewed by a UK-US 
team of leading climate scientists. This new edition, prepared by the same author team, has been 
updated with the most recent climate data and scientific analyses, all of which reinforce our 
understanding of human-caused climate change. 
The evidence is clear. However, due to the nature of science, not every detail is ever totally settled 
or certain. Nor has every pertinent question yet been answered. Scientific evidence continues to 
be gathered around the world. Some things have become clearer and new insights have emerged. 
For example, the period of slower warming during the 2000s and early 2010s has ended with a 
dramatic jump to warmer temperatures between 2014 and 2015. Antarctic sea ice extent, which 
had been increasing, began to decline in 2014, reaching a record low in 2017 that has persisted. 
These and other recent observations have been woven into the discussions of the questions 
addressed in this booklet. 
Calls for action are getting louder. The 2020 Global Risks Perception Survey from the World 
Economic Forum ranked climate change and related environmental issues as the top five global 
risks likely to occur within the next ten years. Yet, the international community still has far to go in 
showing increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation, and other ways to tackle climate change.
Scientific information is a vital component for society to make informed decisions about how to 
reduce the magnitude of climate change and how to adapt to its impacts. This booklet serves as a 
key reference document for decision makers, policy makers, educators, and others seeking 
authoritative answers about the current state of climate-change science. 
We are grateful that six years ago, under the leadership of Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone, former President 
of the National Academy of Sciences, and Sir Paul Nurse, former President of the Royal Society, 
these two organizations partnered to produce a high-level overview of climate change science. As 
current Presidents of these organizations, we are pleased to offer an update to this key reference, 
supported by the generosity of the Cicerone Family.

Climate ChangeGREENHOUSE GASES  such as carbon dioxide (CO2) absorb heat (infrared radiation) 
emitted from Earth’s surface. Increases in the atmospheric concentrations of these 
gases cause Earth to warm by trapping more of this heat. Human activities—especially 
the burning of fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Revolution—have increased 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations by more than 40%, with over half the increase occurring 
since 1970. Since 1900, the global average surface temperature has increased by about 
1 °C (1.8 °F). This has been accompanied by warming of the ocean, a rise in sea level, a 
strong decline in Arctic sea ice, widespread increases in the frequency and intensity 
of heatwaves, and many other associated climate effects. Much of this warming has 
occurred in the last five decades. Detailed analyses have shown that the warming during this period is mainly a result of the increased concentrations of CO
2 and other 
greenhouse gases. Continued emissions of these gases will cause further climate change, 
including substantial increases in global average surface temperature and important 
changes in regional climate. The magnitude and timing of these changes will depend on 
many factors, and slowdowns and accelerations in warming lasting a decade or more will 
continue to occur. However, long-term climate change over many decades will depend 
mainly on the total amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases emitted as a result of 
human activities.Summary

Evidence & Causes 2020 Is the climate warming?
Yes. Earth’s average surface air temperature has increased by about 1 °C (1.8 °F) since 
1900, with over half of the increase occurring since the mid-1970s [Figure 1a]. A wide 
range of other observations (such as reduced Arctic sea ice extent and increased 
ocean heat content) and indications from the natural world (such as poleward shifts 
of temperature-sensitive species of fish, mammals, insects, etc.) together provide 
incontrovertible evidence of planetary-scale warming.
The clearest evidence for surface warming comes from widespread thermometer records that, in some 
places, extend back to the late 19th century. Today, temperatures are monitored at many thousands of 
locations, over both the land and ocean surface. Indirect estimates of temperature change from such 
sources as tree rings and ice cores help to place recent temperature changes in the context of the past. In 
terms of the average surface temperature of Earth, these indirect estimates show that 1989 to 2019 was 
very likely the warmest 30-year period in more than 800 years; the most recent decade, 2010-2019, is the 
warmest decade in the instrumental record so far (since 1850).   
A wide range of other observations provides a more comprehensive picture of warming throughout the 
climate system. For example, the lower atmosphere and the upper layers of the ocean have also warmed, 
snow and ice cover are decreasing in the Northern Hemisphere, the Greenland ice sheet is shrinking, and 
sea level is rising [Figure 1b]. These measurements are made with a variety of land-, ocean-, and space-based 
monitoring systems, which gives added confidence in the reality of global-scale warming of Earth’s climate.Q&A

Evidence & Causes 2020 Q&A nHow do scientists know that recent 
climate change is largely caused by 
human activities?
Scientists know that recent climate change is largely caused by human activities from an 
understanding of basic physics, comparing observations with models, and fingerprinting 
the detailed patterns of climate change caused by different human and natural influences. 
Since the mid-1800s, scientists have known that CO 2 is one of the main greenhouse gases of importance 
to Earth’s energy balance. Direct measurements of CO 2 in the atmosphere and in air trapped in ice show 
that atmospheric CO 2 increased by more than 40% from 1800 to 2019. Measurements of different forms 
of carbon (isotopes, see Question 3) reveal that this increase is due to human activities. Other greenhouse 
gases (notably methane and nitrous oxide) are also increasing as a consequence of human activities. The 
observed global surface temperature rise since 1900 is consistent with detailed calculations of the impacts 
of the observed increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (and other human-induced changes) on Earth’s 
energy balance.
Different influences on climate have different signatures in climate records. These unique fingerprints are 
easier to see by probing beyond a single number (such as the average temperature of Earth’s surface), and 
by looking instead at the geographical and seasonal patterns of climate change. The observed patterns of 
surface warming, temperature changes through the atmosphere, increases in ocean heat content, increases 
in atmospheric moisture, sea level rise, and increased melting of land and sea ice also match the patterns 
scientists expect to see due to human activities (see Question 5).
The expected changes in climate are based on our understanding of how greenhouse gases trap heat. Both 
this fundamental understanding of the physics of greenhouse gases and pattern-based fingerprint studies 
show that natural causes alone are inadequate to explain the recent observed changes in climate. Natural 
causes include variations in the Sun’s output and in Earth’s orbit around the Sun, volcanic eruptions, and 
internal fluctuations in the climate system (such as El Niño and La Niña). Calculations using climate models 
(see infobox, p. 20) have been used to simulate what would have happened to global temperatures if only 
natural factors were influencing the climate system. These simulations yield little surface warming, or even a 
slight cooling, over the 20th century and into the 21st. Only when models include human influences on the 
composition of the atmosphere are the resulting temperature changes consistent with observed changes.2

Climate Changen Q&ACO2 is already in the atmosphere 
naturally, so why are emissions from 
human activity significant?
Human activities have significantly disturbed the natural carbon cycle by extracting long-
buried fossil fuels and burning them for energy, thus releasing CO2 to the atmosphere.
In nature, CO 2 is exchanged continually between the atmosphere, plants, and animals through 
photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition, and between the atmosphere and ocean through gas 
exchange. A very small amount of CO 2 (roughly 1% of the emission rate from fossil fuel combustion) is 
also emitted in volcanic eruptions. This is balanced by an equivalent amount that is removed by chemical 
weathering of rocks.
The CO 2 level in 2019 was more than 40% higher than it was in the 19th century. Most of this CO 2 increase 
has taken place since 1970, about the time when global energy consumption accelerated. Measured 
decreases in the fraction of other forms of carbon (the isotopes 14C and 13C) and a small decrease in 
atmospheric oxygen concentration (observations of which have been available since 1990) show that 
the rise in CO 2 is largely from combustion of fossil fuels (which have low 13C fractions and no 14C). 
Deforestation and other land use changes have also released carbon from the biosphere (living world) 
where it normally resides for decades to centuries. The additional CO 2 from fossil fuel burning and 
deforestation has disturbed the balance of the carbon cycle, because the natural processes that could 
restore the balance are too slow compared to the rates at which human activities are adding CO 2 to the 
atmosphere. As a result, a substantial fraction of the CO 2 emitted from human activities accumulates 
in the atmosphere, where some of it will remain not just for decades or centuries, but for thousands of 
years. Comparison with the CO 2 levels measured in air extracted from ice cores indicates that the current 
concentrations are substantially higher than they have been in at least 800,000 years (see Question 6).3

Evidence & Causes 2020 Q&A nWhat role has the Sun played in 
climate change in recent decades?
The Sun provides the primary source of energy driving Earth’s climate system, but its 
variations have played very little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades. 
Direct satellite measurements since the late 1970s show no net increase in the Sun’s out -
put, while at the same time global surface temperatures have increased  [Figure 2].  
For periods before the onset of satellite measurements, knowledge about solar changes is less certain 
because the changes are inferred from indirect sources — including the number of sunspots and the 
abundance of certain forms (isotopes) of carbon or beryllium atoms, whose production rates in Earth’s 
atmosphere are influenced by variations in the Sun. There is evidence that the 11-year solar cycle, during 
which the Sun’s energy output varies by roughly 0.1%, can influence ozone concentrations, temperatures, 
and winds in the stratosphere (the layer in the atmosphere above the troposphere, typically from 12 to 
50km above earth’s surface, depending on latitude and season). These stratospheric changes may have 
a small effect on surface climate over the 11-year cycle. However, the available evidence does not indicate 
pronounced long-term changes in the Sun’s output over the past century, during which time human-induced increases in CO
2 concentrations have been the dominant influence on the long-term global 
surface temperature increase. Further evidence that current warming is not a result of solar changes can 
be found in the temperature trends at different altitudes in the atmosphere (see Question 5).4
Figure 2.  Measurements of the 
Sun’s energy incident on Earth 
show no net increase in solar forcing during the past 40 years, and therefore this cannot be responsible for warming during that period. The data show only small periodic amplitude variations associated with the Sun’s 11-year cycle. Source: TSI data from

Climate Changen Q&AWhat do changes in the vertical 
structure of atmospheric temperature  
 —f
rom the surface up to the 
stratosphere—tell us about the  
causes of recent climate change? 
The observed warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the upper atmosphere 
provide us with key insights into the underlying causes of climate change and reveal that 
natural factors alone cannot explain the observed changes.
In the early 1960s, results from mathematical/physical models of the climate system first showed that 
human-induced increases in CO 2 would be expected to lead to gradual warming of the lower atmosphere 
(the troposphere) and cooling of higher levels of the atmosphere (the stratosphere). In contrast, increases 
in the Sun’s output would warm both the troposphere and the full vertical extent of the stratosphere. At 
that time, there was insufficient observational data to test this prediction, but temperature measurements 
from weather balloons and satellites have since confirmed these early forecasts. It is now known that the 
observed pattern of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling over the past 40 years is broadly 
consistent with computer model simulations that include increases in CO 2 and decreases in stratospheric 
ozone, each caused by human activities. The observed pattern is not consistent with purely natural changes 
in the Sun’s energy output, volcanic activity, or natural climate variations such as El Niño and La Niña. 
Despite this agreement between the global-scale patterns of modelled and observed atmospheric 
temperature change, there are still some differences. The most noticeable differences are in the tropics, 
where models currently show more warming in the troposphere than has been observed, and in the Arctic, where the observed warming of the troposphere is greater than in most models.5

Evidence & Causes 2020 Q&A nClimate is always changing. Why is 
climate change of concern now? 
All major climate changes, including natural ones, are disruptive. Past climate changes led 
to extinction of many species, population migrations, and pronounced changes in the land 
surface and ocean circulation. The speed of the current climate change is faster than most of 
the past events, making it more difficult for human societies and the natural world to adapt. 
The largest global-scale climate variations in Earth’s recent geological past are the ice age cycles (see infobox, 
p.B4), which are cold glacial periods followed by shorter warm periods [Figure 3].  The last few of these 
natural cycles have recurred roughly every 100,000 years. They are mainly paced by slow changes in Earth’s 
orbit, which alter the way the Sun’s energy is distributed with latitude and by season on Earth. These orbital 
changes are very small over the last several hundred years, and alone are not sufficient to cause the observed 
magnitude of change in temperature since the Industrial Revolution, nor to act on the whole Earth. On ice-age timescales, these gradual orbital variations have led to changes in the extent of ice sheets and in the 
abundance of CO
2 and other greenhouse gases, which in turn have amplified the initial temperature change.
Recent estimates of the increase in global average temperature since the end of the last ice age are 4 to 
5 °C (7 to 9 °F). That change occurred over a period of about 7,000 years, starting 18,000 years ago. CO 2 
has risen more than 40% in just the past 200 years, much of this since the 1970s, contributing to human 
alteration of the planet’s energy budget that has so far warmed Earth by about 1 °C (1.8 °F). If the rise in CO 2 
continues unchecked, warming of the same magnitude as the increase out of the ice age can be expected 
by the end of this century or soon after. This speed of warming is more than ten times that at the end of an 
ice age, the fastest known natural sustained change on a global scale.

Is the current level of atmospheric 
CO2 concentration unprecedented 
in Earth’s history? 
The present level of atmospheric CO2 concentration is almost certainly unprecedented 
in the past million years, during which time modern humans evolved and societies 
developed. The atmospheric CO2 concentration was however higher in Earth’s more 
distant past (many millions of years ago), at which time palaeoclimatic and geological 
data indicate that temperatures and sea levels were also higher than they are today. 
Measurements of air in ice cores show that for the past 800,000 years up until the 20th century, the 
atmospheric CO 2 concentration stayed within the range 170 to 300 parts per million (ppm), making the recent 
rapid rise to more than 400 ppm over 200 years particularly remarkable [figure 3] . During the glacial cycles 
of the past 800,000 years both CO 2 and methane have acted as important amplifiers of the climate changes 
triggered by variations in Earth’s orbit around the Sun. As Earth warmed from the last ice age, temperature 7

Climate Changen Q&AIs there a point at which adding more 
CO2 will not cause further warming? 
No. Adding more CO2 to the atmosphere will cause surface temperatures to continue to 
increase. As the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 increase, the addition of extra CO2 
becomes progressively less effective at trapping Earth’s energy, but surface temperature 
will still rise. 
Our understanding of the physics by which CO 2 affects Earth’s energy balance is confirmed by laboratory 
measurements, as well as by detailed satellite and surface observations of the emission and absorption 
of infrared energy by the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases absorb some of the infrared energy that Earth 
emits in so-called bands of stronger absorption that occur at certain wavelengths. Different gases absorb 
energy at different wavelengths. CO 2 has its strongest heat-trapping band centred at a wavelength of 15 
micrometres (millionths of a metre), with absorption that spreads out a few micrometres on either side. 
There are also many weaker absorption bands. As CO 2 concentrations increase, the absorption at the cen -
tre of the strong band is already so intense that it plays little role in causing additional warming. However, 
more energy is absorbed in the weaker bands and away from the centre of the strong band, causing the 
surface and lower atmosphere to warm further. and CO 2 started to rise at approximately the same time and continued to rise in tandem from about 18,000 
to 11,000 years ago. Changes in ocean temperature, circulation, chemistry, and biology caused CO 2 to be 
released to the atmosphere, which combined with other feedbacks to push Earth into an even warmer state. 
For earlier geological times, CO 2 concentrations and temperatures have been inferred from less direct 
methods. Those suggest that the concentration of CO 2 last approached 400 ppm about 3 to 5 million 
years ago, a period when global average surface temperature is estimated to have been about 2 to 3.5°C 
higher than in the pre-industrial period. At 50 million years ago, CO 2 may have reached 1000 ppm, and 
global average temperature was probably about 10°C warmer than today. Under those conditions, Earth 
had little ice, and sea level was at least 60 metres higher than current levels.

been used to reconstruct Antarctic 
temperatures and atmospheric CO
2 concentrations over the past

2 is measured in 
air trapped in ice, and is a composite of the Dome C and Vostok ice core. The current CO
2 concentration 
(blue dot) is from atmospheric measurements. The cyclical pattern of temperature variations constitutes the ice age/ interglacial cycles. During these cycles, changes in CO
2 concentrations (in blue) track 
closely with changes in temperature (in orange). As the record shows, the recent increase in atmospheric CO
2 concentration is unprecedented 
in the past 800,000 years. Atmospheric CO
2 concentration 
surpassed 400 ppm in 2016, and the average concentration in 2019 was more than 411 ppm. Source:

Evidence & Causes 2020 Q&A nDoes the rate of warming vary from 
one decade to another? 
Yes. The observed warming rate has varied from year to year, decade to decade, and place 
to place, as is expected from our understanding of the climate system. These shorter-
term variations are mostly due to natural causes, and do not contradict our fundamental 
understanding that the long-term warming trend is primarily due to human-induced 
changes in the atmospheric levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
Even as CO 2 is rising steadily in the atmosphere, leading to gradual warming of Earth’s surface, many natural 
factors are modulating this long-term warming. Large volcanic eruptions increase the number of small 
particles in the stratosphere. These particles reflect sunlight, leading to short-term surface cooling lasting 
typically two to three years, followed by a slow recovery. Ocean circulation and mixing vary naturally on many 
time scales, causing variations in sea surface temperatures as well as changes in the rate at which heat is transported to greater depths. For example, the tropical Pacific swings between warm El Niño and cooler La 
Niña events on timescales of two to seven years. Scientists study many different types of climate variations, 
such as those on decadal and multi-decadal timescales in the Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Each 
type of variation has its own unique characteristics. These oceanic variations are associated with significant 
regional and global shifts in temperature and rainfall patterns that are evident in the observations. 
Warming from decade to decade can also be affected by human factors such as variations in emissions of 
greenhouse gases and aerosols (airborne particles that can have both warming and cooling effects) from 
coal-fired power plants and other pollution sources.
These variations in the temperature trend are clearly evident in the observed temperature record 
[Figure 4]. Short-term natural climate variations could also affect the long-term human-induced climate 
change signal and vice-versa, because climate variations on different space and timescales can interact 
with one another. It is partly for this reason that climate change projections are made using climate 
models (see infobox, p.20) that can account for many different types of climate variations and their interactions. Reliable inferences about human-induced climate change must be made with a longer view, 
using records that cover many decades.9
Figure 4.  The climate system varies 
naturally from year to year and from 
decade to decade. To make reliable inferences about human-induced climate change, multi-decadal and longer records are typically used. Calculating a “running average” over these longer timescales allows one to more easily see long-term trends.

Climate Changen Q&A
Did the slowdown of warming during  
 the 2000s to early 2010s mean that 
climate change is no longer happening? 
No. After the very warm year 1998 that followed the strong 1997-98 El Niño, the 
increase in average surface temperature slowed relative to the previous decade of rapid 
temperature increases. Despite the slower rate of warming, the 2000s were warmer than 
the 1990s. The limited period of slower warming ended with a dramatic jump to warmer temperatures between 2014 and 2015, with all the years from 2015-2019 warmer than 
any preceding year in the instrumental record. A short-term slowdown in the warming 
of Earth’s surface does not invalidate our understanding of long-term changes in global 
temperature arising from human-induced changes in greenhouse gases. 
Decades of slow warming as well as decades of accelerated warming occur naturally in the climate system. 
Decades that are cold or warm compared to the long-term trend are seen in the observations of the past 
150 years and are also captured by climate models. Because the atmosphere stores very little heat, surface 
temperatures can be rapidly affected by heat uptake elsewhere in the climate system and by changes in 
external influences on climate (such as particles formed from material lofted high into the atmosphere 
from volcanic eruptions). 
More than 90% of the heat added to the Earth system in recent decades has been absorbed by the oceans 
and penetrates only slowly into deep water. A faster rate of heat penetration into the deeper ocean will 
slow the warming seen at the surface and in the atmosphere, but by itself it will not change the long-term 
warming that will occur from a given amount of CO 2. For example, recent studies show that some heat 
comes out of the ocean into the atmosphere during warm El Niño events, and more heat penetrates to ocean depths in cold La Niñas. Such changes occur repeatedly over timescales of decades and longer. An 
example is the major El Niño event in 1997–98 when the globally averaged air temperature soared to the 
highest level in the 20th century as the ocean lost heat to the atmosphere, mainly by evaporation.
Even during the slowdown in the rise of average surface temperature, a longer-term warming trend 
was still evident (see Figure 4). Over that period, for example, record heatwaves were documented in 
Europe (summer 2003), in Russia (summer 2010), in the USA (July 2012), and in Australia (January 2013). Each of the last four decades was warmer than any previous decade since widespread thermometer 
measurements were introduced in the 1850s. The continuing effects of the warming climate are seen in 
the increasing trends in ocean heat content and sea level, as well as in the continued melting of Arctic sea 
ice, glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet.

Evidence & Causes 2020 Q&A n
Greenhouse gases affect Earth’s energy balance and climate.
The Sun serves as the primary energy source for Earth’s climate. Some of the incoming 
sunlight is reflected directly back into space, especially by bright surfaces such as ice and 
clouds, and the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. Much of this absorbed 
solar energy is re-emitted as heat (longwave or infrared radiation). The atmosphere in turn 
absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this 
balance of incoming and outgoing energy will affect the climate. For example, small changes 
in the output of energy from the Sun will affect this balance directly. 
If all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into 
space, Earth’s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. 
Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, 
and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and 
emit heat energy in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth’s surface and lower 
atmosphere warm  [Figure B1] . Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could not 
have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it 
even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. When the energy leaving is 
less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established.

Greenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth’s energy balance and thus 
its climate. Humans also affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces (for 
example by clearing forests for farming) and through the emission of pollutants that 
affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere.
Scientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, 
Earth’s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor 
being increases in CO2. 
Human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
The atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have 
increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution began. In the case of carbon dioxide, 
the average concentration measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen 
from 316 parts per million (ppm)1 in 1959 (the first full year of data available) to more 
than 411 ppm in 2019 [Figure B2] . The same rates of increase have since been recorded 
at numerous other stations worldwide. Since preindustrial times, the atmospheric 
concentration of CO2 has increased by over 40%, methane has increased by more than 
150%, and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly 20%. More than half of the increase in 
CO2 has occurred since 1970. Increases in all three gases contribute to warming of Earth, 
with the increase in CO2 playing the largest role. See page B3 to learn about the sources of 
human emitted greenhouse gases.  
Scientists have examined greenhouse gases in the context of the past. Analysis of air 
trapped inside ice that has been accumulating over time in Antarctica shows that the CO2 Figure B2. Measurements of

Learn about the sources of human-emitted greenhouse gases:
	 ■Carbon dioxide (CO2) has both 
natural and human sources, but 
CO2 levels are increasing primarily 
because of the combustion of fossil 
fuels, cement production, defor -
estation (which reduces the CO2 
taken up by trees and increases the 
CO2 released by decomposition of 
the detritus), and other land use 
changes. Increases in CO2 are the 
single largest contributor to global 
warming.	 ■Methane (CH4) has both human 
and natural sources, and levels 
have risen significantly since 
pre-industrial times due to human 
activities such as raising livestock, 
growing paddy rice, filling landfills, 
and using natural gas (which is 
mostly CH4, some of which may 
be released when it is extracted, 
transported, and used).
	 ■Nitrous oxide (N2O) concentra -
tions have risen primarily because 
of agricultural activities such as the 
use of nitrogen-based fertilisers and 
land use changes.	 ■Halocarbons , including chloro -
fluorocarbons (CFCs), are chem -
icals used as refrigerants and fire 
retardants. In addition to being potent greenhouse gases, CFCs 
also damage the ozone layer. The 
production of most CFCs has now 
been banned, so their impact is 
starting to decline. However, many 
CFC replacements are also potent 
greenhouse gases and their concen -

Measurements of the forms (isotopes) of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear 
fingerprint of the addition of “old” carbon (depleted in natural radioactive 14C) coming 
from the combustion of fossil fuels (as opposed to “newer” carbon coming from living 
systems). In addition, it is known that human activities (excluding land use changes) 
currently emit an estimated 10 billion tonnes of carbon each year, mostly by burning fossil 
fuels, which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration. 
These and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated CO2 
concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities. 
Climate records show a warming trend.
Estimating global average surface air temperature increase requires careful analysis of 
millions of measurements from around the world, including from land stations, ships, 
and satellites. Despite the many complications of synthesising such data, multiple 
independent teams have concluded separately and unanimously that global average surface air temperature has risen by about 1 °C (1.8 °F) since 1900 
[Figure B4] . Although the 
record shows several pauses and accelerations in the increasing trend, each of the last four 
decades has been warmer than any other decade in the instrumental record since 1850. 
Going further back in time before accurate thermometers were widely available, 
temperatures can be reconstructed using climate-sensitive indicators “proxies” Learn about the ice ages:
Detailed analyses of ocean sediments, 
ice cores, and other data show that for at 
least the last 2.6 million years, Earth has 
gone through extended periods when 
temperatures were much lower than 
today and thick blankets of ice covered large areas of the Northern Hemisphere. 
These long cold spells, lasting in the 
most recent cycles for around 100,000 
years, were interrupted by shorter warm 
‘interglacial’ periods, including the past 
10,000 years.Through a combination of theory, 
observations, and modelling, scientists 
have deduced that the ice ages
* are 
triggered by recurring variations in 
Earth’s orbit that primarily alter the 
regional and seasonal distribution of 
solar energy reaching Earth. These 
relatively small changes in solar energy 
are reinforced over thousands of years by 
gradual changes in Earth’s ice cover (the 
cryosphere), especially over the Northern 
Hemisphere, and in atmospheric 
composition, eventually leading to large changes in global temperature. 
The average global temperature change 
during an ice-age cycle is estimated as 5 
°C ± 1 °C (9 °F ± 2 °F).
*Note that in geological terms Earth has 
been in an ice age ever since the Antarctic 
Ice Sheet last formed about 36 million 
years ago. However, in this document we have used the term in its more colloquial 
usage indicating the regular occurrence of 
extensive ice sheets over North America 
and northern Eurasia.

in materials such as tree rings, ice cores, and marine sediments. Comparisons of the 
thermometer record with these proxy measurements suggest that the time since the early 
1980s has been the warmest 40-year period in at least eight centuries, and that global 
temperature is rising towards peak temperatures last seen 5,000 to 10,000 years ago in the 
warmest part of our current interglacial period . 
Many other impacts associated with the warming trend have become evident in recent 
years. Arctic summer sea ice cover has shrunk dramatically. The heat content of the ocean 
has increased. Global average sea level has risen by approximately 16 cm (6 inches) since 
1901, due both to the expansion of warmer ocean water and to the addition of melt waters 
from glaciers and ice sheets on land. Warming and precipitation changes are altering the 
geographical ranges of many plant and animal species and the timing of their life cycles. 
In addition to the effects on climate, some of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere is being 
taken up by the ocean, changing its chemical composition (causing ocean acidification).Figure B4.  Earth’s global average 
surface temperature has risen, as 
shown in this plot of combined land and ocean measurements from 1850 to 2019 derived from three independent analyses of the available data sets.

Climate Change
basics of climate change
Many complex processes shape our climate. 
Based just on the physics of the amount of energy that CO2 absorbs and emits, a doubling of 
atmospheric CO2 concentration from pre-industrial levels (up to about 560 ppm) would by 
itself cause a global average temperature increase of about 1 °C (1.8 °F). In the overall climate 
system, however, things are more complex; warming leads to further effects (feedbacks) that 
either amplify or diminish the initial warming. 
The most important feedbacks involve various forms of water. A warmer atmosphere generally 
contains more water vapour. Water vapour is a potent greenhouse gas, thus causing more 
warming; its short lifetime in the atmosphere keeps its increase largely in step with warming. 
Thus, water vapour is treated as an amplifier, and not a driver, of climate change. Higher 
temperatures in the polar regions melt sea ice and reduce seasonal snow cover, exposing a 
darker ocean and land surface that can absorb more heat, causing further warming. Another 
important but uncertain feedback concerns changes in clouds. Warming and increases in water 
vapour together may cause cloud cover to increase or decrease which can either amplify or 
dampen temperature change depending on the changes in the horizontal extent, altitude, and 
properties of clouds. The latest assessment of the science indicates that the overall net global 
effect of cloud changes is likely to be to amplify warming.
The ocean moderates climate change. The ocean is a huge heat reservoir, but it is difficult to 
heat its full depth because warm water tends to stay near the surface. The rate at which heat 
is transferred to the deep ocean is therefore slow; it varies from year to year and from decade 
to decade, and it helps to determine the pace of warming at the surface. Observations of the 
sub-surface ocean are limited prior to about 1970, but since then, warming of the upper 700 m 
(2,300 feet) is readily apparent, and deeper warming is also clearly observed since about 1990.
Surface temperatures and rainfall in most regions vary greatly from the global average because 
of geographical location, in particular latitude and continental position. Both the average 
values of temperature, rainfall, and their extremes (which generally have the largest impacts 
on natural systems and human infrastructure), are also strongly affected by local patterns of 
winds. 
Estimating the effects of feedback processes, the pace of the warming, and regional climate 
change requires the use of mathematical models of the atmosphere, ocean, land, and ice 
(the cryosphere) built upon established laws of physics and the latest understanding of the 
physical, chemical and biological processes affecting climate, and run on powerful computers. 
Models vary in their projections of how much additional warming to expect (depending on the 
type of model and on assumptions used in simulating certain climate processes, particularly 
cloud formation and ocean mixing), but all such models agree that the overall net effect of 
feedbacks is to amplify warming.

basics of climate change
Human activities are changing the climate.
Rigorous analysis of all data and lines of evidence shows that most of the observed global 
warming over the past 50 years or so cannot be explained by natural causes and instead 
requires a significant role for the influence of human activities. 
In order to discern the human influence on climate, scientists must consider many natural 
variations that affect temperature, precipitation, and other aspects of climate from local to 
global scale, on timescales from days to decades and longer. One natural variation is the El 
Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), an irregular alternation between warming and cooling 
(lasting about two to seven years) in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that causes significant 
year-to-year regional and global shifts in temperature and rainfall patterns. Volcanic 
eruptions also alter climate, in part increasing the amount of small (aerosol) particles in the 
stratosphere that reflect or absorb sunlight, leading to a short-term surface cooling lasting 
typically about two to three years. Over hundreds of thousands of years, slow, recurring 
variations in Earth’s orbit around the Sun, which alter the distribution of solar energy 
received by Earth, have been enough to trigger the ice age cycles of the past 800,000 years. 
Fingerprinting is a powerful way of studying the causes of climate change. Different influences 
on climate lead to different patterns seen in climate records. This becomes obvious when 
scientists probe beyond changes in the average temperature of the planet and look more 
closely at geographical and temporal patterns of climate change. For example, an increase 
in the Sun’s energy output will lead to a very different pattern of temperature change (across 
Earth’s surface and vertically in the atmosphere) compared to that induced by an increase in 
CO2 concentration. Observed atmospheric temperature changes show a fingerprint much

for forests, farms, or cities — can 
lead to both warming and

changing the reflectivity of Earth’s surfaces (affecting how much 
sunlight is sent back into space) and 
by changing how wet a region is.

basics of climate change
closer to that of a long-term CO2 increase than to that of a fluctuating Sun alone. Scientists 
routinely test whether purely natural changes in the Sun, volcanic activity, or internal climate 
variability could plausibly explain the patterns of change they have observed in many different 
aspects of the climate system. These analyses have shown that the observed climate changes 
of the past several decades cannot be explained just by natural factors. 
How will climate change in the future?
Scientists have made major advances in the observations, theory, and modelling of Earth’s 
climate system, and these advances have enabled them to project future climate change 
with increasing confidence. Nevertheless, several major issues make it impossible to give 
precise estimates of how global or regional temperature trends will evolve decade by decade 
into the future. Firstly, we cannot predict how much CO2 human activities will emit, as this 
depends on factors such as how the global economy develops and how society’s production 
and consumption of energy changes in the coming decades. Secondly, with current 
understanding of the complexities of how climate feedbacks operate, there is a range of 
possible outcomes, even for a particular scenario of CO2 emissions. Finally, over timescales 
of a decade or so, natural variability can modulate the effects of an underlying trend in 
temperature. Taken together, all model projections indicate that Earth will continue to warm 
considerably more over the next few decades to centuries. If there were no technological or 
policy changes to reduce emission trends from their current trajectory, then further globally-
averaged warming of 2.6 to 4.8 °C (4.7 to 8.6 °F) in addition to that which has already 
occurred would be expected during the 21st century [Figure B5] . Projecting what those ranges 
will mean for the climate experienced at any particular location is a challenging scientific 
problem, but estimates are continuing to improve as regional and local-scale models advance. Figure B5. The amount and rate of 
warming expected for the 21st cen -

Evidence & Causes 2020 Q&A n
If the world is warming, why are some 
winters and summers still very cold? 
Global warming is a long-term trend, but that does not mean that every year will be 
warmer than the previous one. Day-to-day and year-to-year changes in weather patterns 
will continue to produce some unusually cold days and nights and winters and summers, 
even as the climate warms. 
Climate change means not only changes in globally averaged surface temperature, but also changes in 
atmospheric circulation, in the size and patterns of natural climate variations, and in local weather. La 
Niña events shift weather patterns so that some regions are made wetter, and wet summers are generally 
cooler. Stronger winds from polar regions can contribute to an occasional colder winter. In a similar way, 
the persistence of one phase of an atmospheric circulation pattern known as the North Atlantic Oscilla -
tion has contributed to several recent cold winters in Europe, eastern North America, and northern Asia.
Atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns will evolve as Earth warms and will influence storm tracks 
and many other aspects of the weather. Global warming tilts the odds in favour of more warm days and 
seasons and fewer cold days and seasons. For example, across the continental United States in the 1960s 
there were more daily record low temperatures than record highs, but in the 2000s there were more than 
twice as many record highs as record lows. Another important example of tilting the odds is that over 
recent decades heatwaves have increased in frequency in large parts of Europe, Asia, South America, and 
Australia. Marine heat waves are also increasing.

Climate Changen Q&AWhy is Arctic sea ice decreasing while 
Antarctic sea ice has changed little? 
Sea ice extent is affected by winds and ocean currents as well as temperature. Sea ice 
in the partly-enclosed Arctic Ocean seems to be responding directly to warming, while 
changes in winds and in the ocean seem to be dominating the patterns of climate and sea 
ice change in the ocean around Antarctica.
Some differences in seasonal sea ice extent between the Arctic and Antarctic are due to basic geography 
and its influence on atmospheric and oceanic circulation. The Arctic is an ocean basin surrounded largely 
by mountainous continental land masses, and Antarctica is a continent surrounded by ocean. In the 
Arctic, sea ice extent is limited by the surrounding land masses. In the Southern Ocean winter, sea ice can 
expand freely into the surrounding ocean, with its southern boundary set by the coastline of Antarctica. 
Because Antarctic sea ice forms at latitudes further from the South Pole (and closer to the equator), less 
ice survives the summer. Sea ice extent in both poles changes seasonally; however, longer-term variability 
in summer and winter ice extent is different in each hemisphere, due in part to these basic geographical 
differences. 
Sea ice in the Arctic has decreased dramatically since the late 1970s, particularly in summer and autumn. Since the satellite record began in 1978, the yearly minimum Arctic sea ice extent (which occurs in September) has decreased by about 40% 
[Figure 5] . Ice cover expands again each Arctic winter, but 
the ice is thinner than it used to be. Estimates of past sea ice extent suggest that this decline may be 
unprecedented in at least the past 1,450 years. Because sea ice is highly reflective, warming is amplified as 
the ice decreases and more sunshine is absorbed by the darker underlying ocean surface.
Sea ice in the Antarctic showed a slight increase in overall extent from 1979 to 2014, although some 
areas, such as that to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula experienced a decrease. Short-term trends in 
the Southern Ocean, such as those observed, 
can readily occur from natural variability of the 
atmosphere, ocean and sea ice system. Changes 
in surface wind patterns around the continent 
contributed to the Antarctic pattern of sea ice change; ocean factors such as the addition of cool 
fresh water from melting ice shelves may also 
have played a role. However, after 2014, Antarctic 
ice extent began to decline, reaching a record low 
(within the 40 years of satellite data) in 2017, and 
remaining low in the following two years.12
Figure 5.  The Arctic summer 
sea ice extent in 2012, (measured 
in September) was a record low, shown (in white) compared to the median summer sea ice extent for 1979 to 2000 (in orange outline). In 2013, Arctic summer sea ice extent rebounded somewhat, but was still the sixth smallest extent on record. In 2019, sea ice extent effectively tied for the second lowest minimum in the satellite record, along with 2007 and 2016—behind only 2012, which is still the record minimum. The 13 lowest ice extents in the satellite era have all occurred in the last 13 years.

Evidence & Causes 2020 Q&A nHow does climate change affect the 
strength and frequency of floods, 
droughts, hurricanes, and tornadoes? 
Earth’s lower atmosphere is becoming warmer and moister as a result of human-caused 
greenhouse gas emissions. This gives the potential for more energy for storms and certain 
extreme weather events. Consistent with theoretical expectations, the types of events most 
closely related to temperature, such as heatwaves and extremely hot days, are becoming 
more likely. Heavy rainfall and snowfall events (which increase the risk of flooding) are also 
generally becoming more frequent.  
As Earth’s climate has warmed, more frequent and more intense weather events have both been observed 
around the world. Scientists typically identify these weather events as “extreme” if they are unlike 90% or 95% 
of similar weather events that happened before in the same region. Many factors contribute to any individual 
extreme weather event—including patterns of natural climate variability, such as El Niño and La Niña—
making it challenging to attribute any particular extreme event to human-caused climate change. However, 
studies can show whether the warming climate made an event more severe or more likely to happen.  
A warming climate can contribute to the intensity of heat waves by increasing the chances of very hot days and 
nights. Climate warming also increases evaporation on land, which can worsen drought and create conditions 
more prone to wildfire and a longer wildfire season. A warming atmosphere is also associated with heavier precipitation events (rain and snowstorms) through increases in the air’s capacity to hold moisture. El Niño 
events favour drought in many tropical and subtropical land areas, while La Niña events promote wetter 
conditions in many places. These short-term and regional variations are expected to become more extreme in 
a warming climate.  
Earth’s warmer and moister atmosphere and warmer oceans make it likely that the strongest hurricanes 
will be more intense, produce more rainfall, affect new areas, and possibly be larger and longer-lived. This 
is supported by available observational evidence in the North Atlantic. In addition, sea level rise (see 
Question 14) increases the amount of seawater that is pushed on to shore during coastal storms, which, 
along with more rainfall produced by the storms, can result in more destructive storm surges and flooding. 
While global warming is likely making hurricanes more intense, the change in the number of hurricanes 
each year is quite uncertain. This remains a subject of ongoing research. 
Some conditions favourable for strong thunderstorms that spawn tornadoes are expected to increase with 
warming, but uncertainty exists in other factors that affect tornado formation, such as changes in the vertical 
and horizontal variations of winds.13

Climate Changen Q&AHow fast is sea level rising? 
Long-term measurements of tide gauges and recent satellite data show that global sea 
level is rising, with the best estimate of the rate of global-average rise over the last decade 
being 3.6 mm per year (0.14 inches per year). The rate of sea level rise has increased since 
measurements using altimetry from space were started in 1992; the dominant factor in 
global-average sea level rise since 1970 is human-caused warming. The overall observed 
rise since 1902 is about 16 cm (6 inches) [Figure 6] .
This sea level rise has been driven by expansion of water volume as the ocean warms, melting of mountain 
glaciers in all regions of the world, and mass losses from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. All of 
these result from a warming climate. Fluctuations in sea level also occur due to changes in the amounts of 
water stored on land. The amount of sea level change experienced at any given location also depends on a 
variety of other factors, including whether regional geological processes and rebound of the land weighted 
down by previous ice sheets are causing the land itself to rise or sink, and whether changes in winds and 
currents are piling ocean water against some coasts or moving water away.
The effects of rising sea level are felt most acutely in the increased frequency and intensity of occasional 
storm surges. If CO 2 and other greenhouse gases continue to increase on their current trajectories, it is 
projected that sea level may rise, at minimum, by a further 0.4 to 0.8 m (1.3 to 2.6 feet) by 2100, although 
future ice sheet melt could make these values considerably higher. Moreover, rising sea levels will not 
stop in 2100; sea levels will be much higher in the following centuries as the sea continues to take up 
heat and glaciers continue to retreat. It remains difficult to predict the details of how the Greenland and 
Antarctic Ice Sheets will respond to continued warming, but it is thought that Greenland and perhaps 
West Antarctica will continue to lose mass, whereas the colder parts of Antarctica could gain mass as 
they receive more snowfall from warmer air that contains more moisture. Sea level in the last interglacial 
(warm) period around 125,000 years ago peaked at probably 5 to 10 m above the present level. During this 
period, the polar regions were warmer than they are today. This suggests that, over millennia, long periods 
of increased warmth will lead to very significant loss of parts of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets 
and to consequent sea level rise.14
Figure 6.  Observations show  
that the global average sea level 
has r
isen by about 16 cm (6 inches) 
since the late 19th century. Sea level 
is rising faster in recent decades; measurements from tide gauges (blue) and satellites (red) indicate that the best estimate for the average sea level rise over the last decade is centred on 3.6 mm per year (0.14 inches per year). The shaded area represents the sea level uncertainty, which has decreased as the number of gauge sites used in calculating the global averages and the number of data points have increased.

Evidence & Causes 2020 Q&A nWhat is ocean acidification and why 
does it matter? 
Direct observations of ocean chemistry have shown that the chemical balance of seawater 
has shifted to a more acidic state (lower pH) [Figure 7] . Some marine organisms (such as 
corals and some shellfish) have shells composed of calcium carbonate, which dissolves 
more readily in acid. As the acidity of sea water increases, it becomes more difficult for 
these organisms to form or maintain their shells.
CO 2 dissolves in water to form a weak acid, and the oceans have absorbed about a third of the CO 2 resulting 
from human activities, leading to a steady decrease in ocean pH levels. With increasing atmospheric CO 2, 
this chemical balance will change even more during the next century. Laboratory and other experiments 
show that under high CO 2 and in more acidic waters, some marine species have misshapen shells and 
lower growth rates, although the effect varies among species. Acidification also alters the cycling of 
nutrients and many other elements and compounds in the ocean, and it is likely to shift the competitive 
advantage among species, with as-yet-to-be-determined impacts on marine ecosystems and the food web. 15
figure 7. As CO 2 in the air has 
increased, there has been an 
increase in the CO 2 content of the 
surface ocean (upper box), and a decrease in the seawater pH (lower box).

Climate Changen Q&A
How confident are scientists that 
Earth will warm further over the 
coming century? 
Very confident. If emissions continue on their present trajectory, without either technologi -
cal or regulatory abatement, then warming of 2.6 to 4.8 °C (4.7 to 8.6 °F) in addition to that 
wh
ich has already occurred would be expected during the 21st century [Figure 8] . 
Warming due to the addition of large amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere can be understood 
in terms of very basic properties of greenhouse gases. It will in turn lead to many changes in natural 
climate processes, with a net effect of amplifying the warming. The size of the warming that will be 
experienced depends largely on the amount of greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere and 
hence on the trajectory of emissions. If the total cumulative emissions since 1875 are kept below about 
900 gigatonnes (900 billion tonnes) of carbon, then there is a two-thirds chance of keeping the rise in 
global average temperature since the pre-industrial period below 2 °C (3.6 °F). However, two-thirds of this 
amount has already been emitted. A target of keeping global average temperature rise below 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) 
would allow for even less total cumulative emissions since 1875.
Based just on the established physics of the amount of heat CO 2 absorbs and emits, a doubling of 
atmospheric CO 2 concentration from preindustrial levels (up to about 560 ppm) would by itself, without 
amplification by any other effects, cause a global average temperature increase of about 1 °C (1.8 °F). 
However, the total amount of warming from a given amount of emissions depends on chains of effects 
(feedbacks) that can individually either amplify or diminish the initial warming.
The most important amplifying feedback is caused by water vapour, which is a potent greenhouse gas. As 
CO 2 increases and warms the atmosphere, the warmer air can hold more moisture and trap more heat in 
the lower atmosphere. Also, as Arctic sea ice and glaciers melt, more sunlight is absorbed into the darker 
underlying land and ocean surfaces, causing further warming and further melting of ice and snow. The 
biggest uncertainty in our understanding of feedbacks relates to clouds (which can have both positive and 
negative feedbacks), and how the properties of clouds will change in response to climate change. 
Other important feedbacks involve the 
carbon cycle. Currently the land and oceans 
together absorb about half of the CO 2 emitted 
from human activities, but the capacities of 
land and ocean to store additional carbon are 
expected to decrease with additional warming, 
leading to faster increases in atmospheric 
CO 2 and faster warming. Models vary in their 
projections of how much additional warming 
to expect, but all such models agree that the 
overall net effect of feedbacks is to amplify 
the warming. 16
figure 8.  If emissions continue 
on their present trajectory, without 
either technological or regulatory abatement, then the best estimate is that global average temperature will warm a further 2.6 to 4.8 °C (4.7 to 8.6 °F) by the end of the century (right). Land areas are projected to warm more than ocean areas and hence more than the global mean. The figure on the left shows projected warming with very aggressive emissions reductions. The figures represent multi-model estimates of temperature averages for 2081-2100 compared to 1986–2005.

Evidence & Causes 2020 Q&A nAre climate changes of a few degrees 
a cause for concern? 
Yes. Even though an increase of a few degrees in global average temperature does not 
sound like much, global average temperature during the last ice age was only about 4 to 
5 °C (7 to 9 °F) colder than now. Global warming of just a few degrees will be associated 
with widespread changes in regional and local temperature and precipitation as well as 
with increases in some types of extreme weather events. These and other changes (such 
as sea level rise and storm surge) will have serious impacts on human societies and the 
natural world.
Both theory and direct observations have confirmed that global warming is associated with greater warming 
over land than oceans, moistening of the atmosphere, shifts in regional precipitation patterns, increases in 
extreme weather events, ocean acidification, melting glaciers, and rising sea levels (which increases the risk of 
coastal inundation and storm surge). Already, record high temperatures are on average significantly outpacing 
record low temperatures, wet areas are becoming wetter as dry areas are becoming drier, heavy rainstorms 
have become heavier, and snowpacks (an important source of freshwater for many regions) are decreasing. 
These impacts are expected to increase with greater warming and will threaten food production, 
freshwater supplies, coastal infrastructure, and especially the welfare of the huge population currently 
living in low-lying areas. Even though certain regions may realise some local benefit from the warming, the 
long-term consequences overall will be disruptive. 
It is not only an increase of a few degrees in global average temperature that is cause for concern—the pace 
at which this warming occurs is also important (see Question 6). Rapid human-caused climate changes 
mean that less time is available to allow for adaptation measures to be put in place or for ecosystems to 
adapt, posing greater risks in areas vulnerable to more intense extreme weather events and rising sea levels.17
What are scientists doing to 
address key uncertainties in our 
understanding of the climate system? 
Science is a continual process of observation, understanding, modelling, testing, and 
prediction. The prediction of a long-term trend in global warming from increasing 
greenhouse gases is robust and has been confirmed by a growing body of evidence. 
Nevertheless, understanding of certain aspects of climate change remains incomplete. 
Examples include natural climate variations on decadal-to-centennial timescales and  
regional-to-local spatial scales and cloud responses to climate change, which are all areas  
of active research.18

Climate Changen Q&AComparisons of model predictions with observations identify what is 
well-understood and, at the same time, reveal uncertainties or gaps in 
our understanding. This helps to set priorities for new research. Vigilant 
monitoring of the entire climate system—the atmosphere, oceans, 
land, and ice—is therefore critical, as the climate system may be full of 
surprises. 
Together, field and laboratory data and theoretical understanding are used 
to advance models of Earth’s climate system and to improve representation 
of key processes in them, especially those associated with clouds, aerosols, 
and transport of heat into the oceans. This is critical for accurately simulating 
climate change and associated changes in severe weather, especially at the 
regional and local scales important for policy decisions. 
Simulating how clouds will change with warming and in turn may affect 
warming remains one of the major challenges for global climate models, 
in part because different cloud types have different impacts on climate, 
and the many cloud processes occur on scales smaller than most current 
models can resolve. Greater computer power is already allowing for some 
of these processes to be resolved in the new generation of models.
Dozens of groups and research institutions work on climate models, 
and scientists are now able to analyse results from essentially all of the 
world’s major Earth-System Models and compare them with each other 
and with observations. Such opportunities are of tremendous benefit 
in bringing out the strengths and weaknesses of various models and 
diagnosing the causes of differences among models, so that research 
can focus on the relevant processes. Differences among models allow 
estimates to be made of the uncertainties in projections of future climate 
change. Additionally, large archives of results from many different 
models help scientists to identify aspects of climate change projections 
that are robust and that can be interpreted in terms of known physical 
mechanisms.
Studying how climate responded to major changes in the past is another 
way of checking that we understand how different processes work and that 
models are capable of performing reliably under a wide range of conditions.
Why are computer models used to 
study climate change?
The future evolution of Earth’s climate as it responds to 
the present rapid rate of increasing atmospheric CO 2 has 
no precise analogues in the past, nor can it be properly understood through laboratory experiments. As we are also unable to carry out deliberate controlled experiments on Earth itself, computer models are among the most important tools used to study Earth’s climate system.
Climate models are based on mathematical equations 
that represent the best understanding of the basic laws of physics, chemistry, and biology that govern the behaviour of the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, ice, and other parts of the climate system, as well as the interactions among them. The most comprehensive climate models, Earth-System Models, are designed to simulate Earth’s climate system with as much detail as is permitted by our understanding and by available supercomputers. 
The capability of climate models has improved steadily 
since the 1960s. Using physics-based equations, the models can be tested and are successful in simulating a broad range of weather and climate variations, for example from individual storms, jet stream meanders, El Niño events, and the climate of the last century. Their projections of the most prominent features of the long-term human-induced climate change signal have remained robust, as generations of increasingly complex models yield richer details of the change. They are also 
used to perform experiments to 
isolate specific causes of climate change and to explore the consequences of different scenarios of future greenhouse gas 
emissions and other influences on climate.

Evidence & Causes 2020 Q&A nAre disaster scenarios about tipping 
points like “turning off the Gulf 
Stream” and release of methane from 
the Arctic a cause for concern?
Results from the best available climate models do not predict an abrupt change in (or 
collapse of) the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which includes the Gulf 
Stream, in the near future. However, this and other potential high-risk abrupt changes, like 
the release of methane and carbon dioxide from thawing permafrost, remain active areas 
of scientific research. Some abrupt changes are already underway, such as the decrease in 
Arctic sea ice extent (see Question 12), and as warming increases, the possibility of other 
major abrupt changes cannot be ruled out. 
The composition of the atmosphere is changing towards conditions that have not been experienced for 
millions of years, so we are headed for unknown territory, and uncertainty is large. The climate system 
involves many competing processes that could switch the climate into a different state once a threshold 
has been exceeded.
A well-known example is the south-north ocean overturning circulation, which is maintained by cold salty 
water sinking in the North Atlantic and involves the transport of extra heat to the North Atlantic via the 
Gulf Stream. During the last ice age, pulses of freshwater from the melting ice sheet over North America 
led to slowing down of this overturning circulation. This in turn caused widespread changes in climate 
around the Northern Hemisphere. Freshening of the North Atlantic from the melting of the Greenland ice 
sheet is gradual, however, and hence is not expected to cause abrupt changes.  
Another concern relates to the Arctic, where substantial warming could destabilise methane (a 
greenhouse gas) trapped in ocean sediments and permafrost, potentially leading to a rapid release of 
a large amount of methane. If such a rapid release occurred, then major, fast climate changes would 
ensue. Such high-risk changes are considered unlikely in this century, but are by definition hard to predict. 
Scientists are therefore continuing to study the possibility of exceeding such tipping points, beyond which 
we risk large and abrupt changes.
In addition to abrupt changes in the climate system itself, steady climate change can cross thresholds that 
trigger abrupt changes in other systems. In human systems, for example, infrastructure has typically been 
built to accommodate the climate variability at the time of construction. Gradual climate changes can 
cause abrupt changes in the utility of the infrastructure—such as when rising sea levels suddenly surpass 
sea walls, or when thawing permafrost causes the sudden collapse of pipelines, buildings, or roads. In 
natural systems, as air and water temperatures rise, some species—such as the mountain pika and many 
ocean corals—will no longer be able to survive in their current habitats and will be forced to relocate (if 
possible) or rapidly adapt. Other species may fare better in the new conditions, causing abrupt shifts in 
the balance of ecosystems; for example, warmer temperatures have allowed more bark beetles to survive 
over winter in some regions, where beetle outbreaks have destroyed forests. 19

Climate Changen Q&AIf emissions of greenhouse gases were 
stopped, would the climate return 
to the conditions of 200 years ago? 
No. Even if emissions of greenhouse gases were to suddenly stop, Earth’s surface temperature 
would require thousands of years to cool and return to the level in the pre-industrial era.
If emissions of CO 2 stopped altogether, it would take many thousands of years for atmospheric CO 2 to 
return to “pre-industrial” levels due to its very slow transfer to the deep ocean and ultimate burial in ocean 
sediments. Surface temperatures would stay elevated for at least a thousand years, implying a long-term 
commitment to a warmer planet due to past and current emissions. Sea level would likely continue 
to rise for many centuries even after temperature stopped increasing [Figure 9] . Significant cooling 
would be required to reverse melting of glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet, which formed during past 
cold climates. The current CO 2-induced warming of Earth is therefore essentially irreversible on human 
timescales. The amount and rate of further warming will depend almost entirely on how much more CO 2 
humankind emits.
Scenarios of future climate change increasingly assume the use of technologies that can remove green -
house gases from the atmosphere. In such “negative emissions” scenarios, it assumed that at some point 
in the future, widespread effort 
will be undertaken that utilises 
such technologies to remove 
CO 2 from the atmosphere and 
lower its atmospheric concentra -
tion, thereby starting to reverse 
CO 2-driven warming on longer 
timescales. Deployment of such 
technologies at scale would 
require large decreases in their 
costs. Even if such technological 
fixes were practical, substantial 
reductions in CO 2 emissions 
would still be essential.20
figure 9.  If global emissions 
were to suddenly stop, it would 
take a long time for surface air temperatures and the ocean to begin to cool because the excess CO
2 in the atmosphere would 
remain there for a long time and would continue to exert a warming effect. Model projections show how atmospheric CO
2 concentration 
(a), surface air temperature (b), and ocean thermal expansion (c) would respond following a scenario of business-as-usual emissions ceasing in 2300 (red), a scenario of aggressive emission reductions, falling close to zero 50 years from now (orange), and two intermediate emissions scenarios (green and blue). The small downward tick in temperature at 2300 is caused by the elimination of emissions of short-lived greenhouse gases, including methane.

Evidence & Causes 2020 This document explains that there are well-understood physical mechanisms by which 
changes in the amounts of greenhouse gases cause climate changes. It discusses the 
evidence that the concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere have increased and 
are still increasing rapidly, that climate change is occurring, and that most of the recent 
change is almost certainly due to emissions of greenhouse gases caused by human 
activities. Further climate change is inevitable; if emissions of greenhouse gases continue 
unabated, future changes will substantially exceed those that have occurred so far. There 
remains a range of estimates of the magnitude and regional expression of future change, 
but increases in the extremes of climate that can adversely affect natural ecosystems and 
human activities and infrastructure are expected. 
Citizens and governments can choose among several options (or a mixture of those 
options) in response to this information: they can change their pattern of energy 
production and usage in order to limit emissions of greenhouse gases and hence the magnitude of climate changes; they can wait for changes to occur and accept the losses, 
damage, and suffering that arise; they can adapt to actual and expected changes as much 
as possible; or they can seek as yet unproven “geoengineering” solutions to counteract 
some of the climate changes that would otherwise occur. Each of these options has 
risks, attractions and costs, and what is actually done may be a mixture of these different 
options. Different nations and communities will vary in their vulnerability and their capacity to adapt. There is an important debate to be had about choices among these options, to decide what is best for each group or nation, and most importantly for the 
global population as a whole. The options have to be discussed at a global scale because 
in many cases those communities that are most vulnerable control few of the emissions, 
either past or future. Our description of the science of climate change, with both its facts 
and its uncertainties, is offered as a basis to inform that policy debate.Conclusion
